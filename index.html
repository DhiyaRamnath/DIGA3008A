        <h3> Setting Up Github and Publishing Pages</h3>
                <p> When I first decided to take this course, I always though building websites would be incredibly complicated, especially with the vast amount of coding knowledge out there.
                But once I set up GitHub and publish the site, i found it much more manageable that expected. It actually gave me peace of mind that it wasn't as intimidating as I thought it would be! 
               However, I did struggle a bit with some of the GitHub terminology, like "push" and "fetch," but I quickly got the hang of it with a little practice.</p>

                <h3>My Goals for this Course</h3>
                <p>
                    Although creating websites is just the basis of what I want to do, I’m really eager to dive deeper into understanding <b>user interfaces and experiences.</b>
                    I’m fascinated by how human psychology intertwines with digital media, and I want to expand my expertise in this area. 
                    My goal is to design user experiences that are not only fun and interactive but also accessible for those who may not be heavy internet users. 
                    Beyond the fun side of things, I also want to improve my coding skills, especially when it comes to structuring my thinking and <b>problem-solving</b> using code.

        <h3>Reflection on the Readings Selected - Related to My Experience with the Internet Today and Interesting Things Found About The History of the Web</h3>
                <p>
                    I enjoyed reading Berners-Lee et al. (1994) - World Wide Web because it filled the gaps in my knowledge of the Web. 
                    The reading explained the syntaxes, protocols and the meanings and processes of the prefixes which I never understood. 
                    What I did find interesting in this reading was the prediction of the future particularly the emphasis on interactivity, which seemed to resonate throughout this week's readings. 
                    Many of these predictions are relevant today. One of the predictions that stood out to me was the idea of "integration with cocurrent editors and other real-time features such as teleconfrencing and virtual reality." (Berners-Lee, T. et al., 1994, Pg. 81). 
                    After the COVID pandemic and remote work, this feature of the Web became so prominent that businesses and workplaces were using this to keep their businesses functioning remotely. 
                    Virtual Reality has also become prominent in the modern day, especially in the gaming and animation industries with tons of different games and animations that used VR to create new experiences. <br>

                    Apart from learning was exactly the Web is, it was interesting to see the thinking behind the creation of the web.
                    Although it focuses more on furthering technological development, it prioritizes the human psyche and its abilities in understanding information and associating ideas as a way to format this new sort of technology.
                    Berners-Lee highlights how the web was designed to cater to human thinking patterns, making it easier for us to associate ideas and interact with the content. He explains "... the personalisation and adaptive hypermedia domain there is far more scope to personalise the experience of the information we gather as opposed to the use of purely static structures..." (Harper, 2010, Pg. 3). 
                    The development of Web 2.0 also shows just how important interactivity and user experience became a focal point in web development since Web 1.0 everything was "static", limited and passive using "basic CSS, HTML and frames" whereas web 2.0 was dynamic and highly interactive. (Wikipedia Contributors, 2019) <br>

                    Apart from how impeccable the development of the Web is, there is always some sort of down side to it, which were prominent in the articles, "A revealing look at the dot-com bubble of 2000 — and how it shapes our lives today" and "‘Crush Them’: An Oral History of the Lawsuit That Upended Silicon Valley". 
                    I think articles like this show how failures in revolutionary developments in technology and internet companies are very important lessons that people in the industry need to always keep at the back of their minds.  
                    Especially with the information overload on the internet and the speed at which its developing, its important to also just take a step and look around. These failures are crucial reminders for anyone in the industry to stay updated on news and policies, as the speed of internet development can easily leave them unaware of potentially harmful shifts in power. 
                    And since the internet is so new and its usage is increasing and is constantly in a state of development, the rules surrounding the internet have loopholes with tons of ways that actually are harmful to society and the businesses online. The Silicon Valley Lawsuit article captured this tension, quoting the defense’s argument: “One of the phrases they were using is ‘freedom to innovate.’ (Theringer.com, 2018) that was kind of the master narrative that the Microsoft legal team was advancing.” 
                    It’s a reminder that while innovation is vital, the way it’s framed can have consequences. But at the end of the day, I've come to realise that a lot of the failures that have come start ups and developments in technology are still just as important as the ones that make it big. They, if fact, end up forming the back bone of a lot of the infrastructures for online businesses. 
                    "The dot-coms from that time, the training wheels for the internet, taught us to live online." (McCullough, 2018).

            <h1>Week 2 Blog Post</h1>
                <h3> Reflect on Moulthrop, S. (2003) ‘You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991).
                    How does it speak to the internet today? </h3>
                    <p> The Moulthrop reading was long but a rather important analysis to how the original functions of Hypertext has been manipulated by the state of the digital landscape, being commercialised. The reason why the idea of the internet came about was for the sake of creating this enormous library of knowledge that was interactive- where people from around the world could contribute to this knowledge. But instead, it's being used mainly for commercial purposes. And although people are able to express themselves and their thoughts online, society's experience online is controlled by cooperations which in turn undermines its original function. He makes reference to Vannevar Bush's "Memex" and Theodor Nelson's Xanadu to explain they both envisioned the "interactive docuverse" which consolidates his critique of the modern day internet. Moulthrop expresses that The open and dynamic docuverse that hypertext was supposed to bring can’t be sensed in the pullulation of possibilities today…" (Moulthrop, 2003, pg. 691) This, I feel, has become so much more relevant today since the Internet has become a commercial hub.

                        He notes that cooperations like Yahoo and CNN control our digital experiences. In the modern day internet, there are even more cooperations that control our experience online. For example, Youtube (Google) makes use of algorithms to determine the content that gets the most engagement and consumer reach which downplays independent creators and media. IOS App Store (Apple) removes apps that challenge political narratives like the app "HK Map Live", which was designed to help protestors to locate police and demonstrations. (Paunescu, 2019). X (Twitter) along with Facebook supressed the political discussions around the Hunter Biden laptop story where he left his laptop at a repair shop in Delaware and information suggesting he was engaging in "questionable business dealings abroad" was found. (Desk, 2024)
                        
                        It was so interesting to see how Moulthrop's utilises "McLuhan's 4 Media Questions" to talk about the effect of hypertext and just how relevant it becomes in communication today:
                        
                        • What does hypertext enhance or intensify?: I's explained that hypertext allows for people to link ideas dynamically instead of following a linear structure by fostering an "ethos of connection" (Moulthrop, 2003, pg. 697).  In today's society, things like AI generated content is under algorithmic control, where information is filtered and guides users to specific content which in turn controls the way users access and understand knowledge. 
                        
                        
                        • What does hypertext render obsolete or displace?: Hypertext competes with "post-literacy" (television communication) which engages users more by being more interactive. (Moulthrop, 2003, pg. 698). He notes that traditional broadcasting only has the users interacting passively. However in society's digital experience today, interactivity is an illusion. For example, journalism today makes use of clickbait and sensationalism to attract its readers, rather than providing in-depth reports of current affairs. 
                        
                        
                        • What does hypertext retrieve that was previously obsolete?:  Its explained that we have the "power to revive print literacy" (Moulthrop, 2003, pg. 699) in a new digital form to transform the linearity of text into more interactive and dynamic forms. But, today, these "dynamic forms" are manipulated to spread propaganda within communities online. For example, Reddit was a platform for people share and comment on stories and knowledge but has now become heavily censored and monetized, which is probably to ensure that people are only exposed to certain ideologies. 
                        
                        
                        • What does hypertext produce or become when taken to its limit?:  Moulthrop references  McLuhan’s "reversal" theory, that “every form, pushed to the limit of its potential, reverses its characteristics”  (Moulthrop, 2003, pg. 701) to predict what could possibly happen if hypertext reaches its peak. Hypertext was supposed to be a democratic space for people to share and contribute to knowledge but today, where hypertext becomes most popularised, it's now a controlled space with a hierarchy that controls and centralises media and advertisements.

                    <p>
                            https://bruno-simon.com/#: This website was so refreshing! I never thought of implementing animation into something like a portfolio. It really immerses the user to drive the car around to see the rest of Bruno's portfolio. There are also some fun elements where the user can just drive around and knock down blocks. I enjoyed this aspect and found it refreshing because it uses 3d animation which isn’t as common in website portfolios- most are just 2D and static.

                            https://webandcrafts.com/: I loved how they incorporated the mouse scrolling when going through the home page. The scroll controls the animations and the information presented to the user so they can determine how fast they see information. I thought it was a unique way to make a website interactive. 

                            https://www.benjamin-nespoulous.com/: I enjoyed the simplicity in the design of this website with thin lines and tables and a tri-colour colour scheme (shades of purple). I also like how when you move the mouse it highlights the tabs you're looking at. Another aspect I liked what that it was entirely just text, which contributes to its minimalism. But when you hover over the name of a project, the user gets a little preview of what the end product looked like!

                            https://www.enricodeiana.design/: I loved the typography and the use of space in this website. The information presented is minimal and allows for the user to comprehend all the features on the website one by one. Even when you click on the product, it features every aspect of the information and designs of the product at your own pace, assisted by the white space amongst the designs. 

                            https://www.melaniedaveid.com/: It was interesting to see how this website functions without tabs for navigation. I enjoyed how when looking at her different products felt like flipping to cards which I thought was immersive. 

                            http://seanhalpin.xyz/: I loved the minimalism in this website however my most favourite feature is the user's ability to change from day mode to night mode at the bottom of the page. Although I wouldn't exactly place this at the end of the page and rather at the beginning, it assists in making the user's experience more comfortable, since this website makes use of vibrant colours. 

                            https://mxb.dev/: This website uses a social media structure in his structure of his website. When you click on the "Writing" or "Notes" tab, it looks like tweets you'd find on Twitter. I think it was really intuitive to use this sort of structure in a website because it becomes so much more personal, as if you're looking at his profile on social media. It was also cool how you could change the colours of his website. The names of the colour palettes are named after popular worlds and environments from Nintendo games. 

                            https://www.stevenmengin.com/: I loved the dark minimalism in this website. I think black fills white space beautifully.

                <h3>Reflect on interaction and the www: what does interaction mean to you?</h3>
                     <p>
                            Interactivity, to me, is not just about communication and user response. It is about making meaning, almost an act of exchanging energy and emotion. On a deeper level, the most important interaction that can leave a user feeling immersed is our inner, cognitive interaction. It's how we engage with concepts and ideas to reflect and process experiences. I also feel that storytelling is an important factor that shapes how we understand and experience narratives.
