            <section>
                <p>The article “How Geography Shapes—and Is Shaped by—the Internet” by Shane Greenstein, Chris Forman, and Avi Goldfarb talks about the interplay between digital connectivity and geographical location. It was published in the New Oxford Handbook of Economic Geography (2018). This article argues that the internet doesn't reduce the significance of distance but rather interacts with local conditions like infrastructure, economic and social preferences which in turn creates uneven outcomes. This is where the author challenges the "death of distance" hypothesis (Cairncross, 1997). "Death of distance" is the idea that digital technologies erase geographical constraints by demonstrating that the internet's effects are mediated by existing spatial inequalities. This analysis spans over sectors like economic productivity, innovation, consumer behavior, globalisation. Using these sectors, they unify both digital and physical spaces and express how they co-evolve.</p>

            <section>
                <p>The article begins by critiquing the assumption that the internet completely diminishes the role of geography. The author proposes that technology more so reduces 3 economic factors: communication, transportation and search costs and that the magnitude of its reduction depends and varies on the local conditions. For example, even though email eliminates distance-based communication costs, face-to-face interactions remain crucial for complex knowledge exchange and has "unique advantages" (Greenstein et al., 2018, pp..3). Whereas, digital distribution lowers costs for information-based goods, like e-books, but physical goods still incur shipping expenses that may be higher in remote areas. The author argues that the internet's impact is contingent on local factors like the availability of substitutes and regional preferences. For example, urban areas where there are more skilled workers and better infrastructures, are in a better position to leverage advanced internet technologies whereas rural regions will struggle despite the higher marginal benefits. (Greenstein et al., 2018, pp. 4). The authors therefore reject the determination of future technology and instead presents and labels the internet as a tool whose effects are shaped by and shape geographical disparities. To critique this paragraph, I believe that the study makes a clear distinction between digital and physical goods, highlighting how transportation costs remain a barrier in certain regions. However, I feel like it heavily relies on examples from a long time ago and from the early internet. These do not fully capture the dynamics and capabilities of today's more advanced digital economy. For example, the rise of AI and its communication platforms and virtual reality meetings. These could challenge the assumption that face to face interactions remaining irreplaceable for complex knowledge work. It also doesn’t address how technologies like drones and decentralised networks can reduce transportation costs in remote areas which can further diminish geographic barriers.</p>

                <p>The author goes on to examine how geography influences the usage of the internet among companies and individuals. Specifically, they highlight the paradox - even though rural firms and consumers benefit from reduced isolation, they face high internet usage barriers due to limited broadband access and less IT service providers. Forman et al. (2005, pg 6) finds that basic internet technologies are found widely across locations but the more advanced applications like cloud computing and data analytics are found more in the urban centers. This means that firms can access a more specialised technologies, leading to lower implementation costs for businesses. However for individuals, the use of these internet technologies have massive gaps, regardless of factors like income and education. Agarwal et al. (2009, pp. 8) explains this idea of "social spillovers" worsen these geographic disparities. This means that the internet broadband is uneven, especially in rural areas because of the lack of investment in these communities. (Prieger, 2003; Flamm, 2005, pp. 5). This highlights that the digital divide isn't just about access to the technologies but because of the localised capacity. This idea contributes to one of the most striking arguments in the article: The internet amplifies the regional inequality rather than leveling the economic playing field.</p>

            <section>
                <p>Forman et al. (2012, pp. 6) analyze U.S. data and find that IT investment only boosts wages and employment in urban areas—like the tech hubs in Silicon Valley and New York. Similar patterns appear in healthcare IT (Dranove et al., 2014, pp. 6) where hospitals in tech-dense areas reap efficiency gains faster than those in less-connected regions. This article highlights this idea of "balkanisation" (Van Alstyne & Brynjolfsson, 2005, pp. 8)where digital platforms enable these communities to deepen these divides between the groups, hence grounding the tension between connectivity and fragmentation. To critique this paragraph, I feel like this section of the article didn’t engage enough with the exceptions which led to its "quick fix" of presenting the "balkanization" framework as a solution. I feel that this analysis might be too ambitious with the "balkanization" framework. This framework oversimplifies the connection between connectivity and fragmentation. There are various digital platforms that can actively bridge divides like "Allison", "Coursera" and "EdX" where people can learn about computer science. It also focused on U.S data which can overlook the cases in developing regions.</p>

            <section>
                <p>The article expands on the globalisation of the internet by measuring its impact on international trade and its integration into the economy. Even though it has reduced the barriers in transactions over the borders, the author warns us against overstating their transformative power. They draw on Freund (2002) and Weinhold’s (2004) research to show that the Internet has a more pronounced effect on trade in services than in goods. Because many services like software development and digital media can be delivered online, it eliminates the need for physical transportation. However, the author notes that not all services are equally tradable. They make use of Blinder’s (2006) framework where they distinguish between "routine" tasks (data entry, call centers) that can be done over borders and "non-routine" tasks (problem-solving, creative work) that remain geographically sticky. This polarizes the labor market where digitization benefits the highly skilled, non routine jobs in urban areas whilst displacing the middle-skill, routine jobs to low cost regions. A striking deduction from this is that the internet does not eliminate the importance of geography in global trade but rather reconfigures it. For example, digital platforms enabling small business in developing countries to access global markets (small artists selling their goods over Etsy), noting that this only really happens in areas with reliable infrastructure and digital literacy. (Graham & Mann, 2013). Along with this, the author notes some irregularities in digital laws like data privacy, copyright restrictions that create these digital borders. To critique this paragraph, again I feel that the relevance of the sources are lacking since they're outdated. For example, the advancements in AI and automation make the "non routine" jobs a lot more doable from anywhere.  I believe that the focus on the laws are imperative however there are various other socio-political issues happening over the internet that may have a bigger impact like reshaping the digital trade way more than copyright rules. For example, the U.S and China split with the Huawei and TikTok bans, creating 2 separate internets.  It’s a new kind of "digital border" that could lock countries into competing tech ecosystems.</p>
