            <h2>Critical Reflection</h2>
            
            <section>
                <p>Christoph Lutz's "Digital Inequalities in the Age of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data" is an article about the digital inequalities through 3 layers: access to technology, skills and uses (who can navigate the algorithms) and outcomes as in who benefits or suffers from these technological systems. It connects these divides to the emerging technologies of today like AI and big data. The article argues that existing social inequalities are mirrored and worsened by digital technologies. It in fact creates a new form of exclusion. The article also emphasizes that these divides are not merely technical glitches but rather systemic issues that requires solutions before the divide worsens. This resonates with my own critique of technology questioning who in fact gets to shape the digital future? Who has the most agency and power over these technologies?</p>

                <p>Lutz discusses 3 layers of digital inequalities. The first one is "access" which highlights how access to technologies like AI and IoT is limited as of factors like socio-economic status, geography, and age. He critiques these powered systems as "walled gardens" or "prison yards" (Lutz, 2019, p. 143) which are controlled by big corporations like Amazon and Apple. This This resonates with the idea that capitalist structures in fact control one's access to technology which helps these corporations reinforce its dominance in society. This further deems it as something that isn't neutral. With these tech giants monopolizing the AI structures deepens this idea of "surveillance capitalism" where user data is used to consolidate power. From my understanding, corporate control intersects with this idea of identity. We need to look at who exactly this tech is built for. For example, Siri wouldn't understand what you say if you have an accent. Or communities with indigenous languages won’t be able to use AI because the AI doesn't understand the language. I believe it all isn’t just a technical error. Its more about who the system is coded for.</p>

            <section>
                <p>The second layer of digital inequalities is "skills and uses" which explains how privileged groups often use platforms and job markets a lot more effectively because of their digital literacy. Lutz ties this idea to Bourdieu's concept of "cultural capital" (Lutz, 2019, p.145). Cultural capital is the idea that education and social background shapes the way a person comprehends and understands digital tools. In knowing this, how does the algorithm deepen this gap? It isn't evenly distributed. The focus on individual skills undermine the systemic barriers in place. Platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk relies on vague algorithms to assign microtasks and pay rates to trap works in a low-wage role. (Lutz, 2019, p. 143). The more privileged works might cherry pick higher paying pickups how others that are lacking the time and resources get stuck in tireless cycle. Also, marginalized groups are already held back by the unequal access to education (furthering the fact that they don’t even have the access to technology!). This means that they don’t even have the tools to dismantle the biases in the algorithm that influences financial and job decisions. This in turn creates this vicious cycle where those who don’t even understand the algorithm are undermined by systems that pretend to be neutral.</p>

            <section>
                <p>The third layer of digital inequalities is "outcomes" which focuses of the real world impacts of the use of technology. Lutz points out that marginalized groups suffer more from data exploitation like biased algorithms and surveillance. This is tied to factors of race, class, and gender layers. Lutz notes how cryptocurrency, supposedly for financial freedom, only benefits the already privileged meanwhile the underprivileged are blocked from accessing it. Another example Lutz notes is how government surveillance systems targets marginalized, underprivileged communities like poor women. These poor women are monitored as "test subjects for invasive technology. (Lutz, 2019, p. 144). However, I feel that Lutz's analysis focuses more on individual harm and misses the systemic violence of how large corporations extract data. For example. Facebook dominates within the social media market where users don't have any other alternatives. These users generate large amounts of data through their online activity which fuels and encourages the algorithm's engagement and ad revenue. Yet, this data rarely benefits the local communities since the tools are designed for making a profit. The final point is that these tech giants gain massive profits whereas the marginalized communities bear the costs by being exploited.</p>

            <section>
                <p>In proposing a possible solution to these layers of digital inequalities, Lutz argues that researchers should bridge digital inequality research with critical studies on the algorithm with huge consideration on addressing participatory justice. Marginalized communities are considered as just data suppliers rather than active contributors to designing technology. In my opinion, to decolonize this system would require redistributing power and agency over the development of AI to various demographics and classifications of people, not just the powerful, privileged and able. In this way, we can challenge the practices that marginalize people and shift our focus to making technology and the technology that comes with it more accessible to people.</p>
