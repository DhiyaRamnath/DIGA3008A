            <h1>ARTICLE 1</h1>
            <h2>Are Dystopian Novels a Cautionary Warning?</h2>
            
            <section>
                <p>Stories like 1984 and The Handmaid's Tale turned out to be more relevant today than imagined. The article's main point was simple, that these stories are warnings about how technology and power (in the wrong hands) can cause issues in our society if we aren't careful. The article does a great job linking fictional to real-life horrors. For example China's social credit system where the government scores your trustworthiness based on what you buy or post or when Facebook sold people's data to advertisers. The article name drops Shoshana Zuboff’s Surveillance Capitalism (2019), which argues that companies profit by spying on us, similarly to the novel 1984 except Big Brother is Mark Zuckerburg. However I do feel like the article is being entirely pessimistic about the state of technology and doesn't provide the reader with a rebuttal. It makes it seem like there is nothing we can do about this impending doom however people are fighting back. The "Stop LAPD Spying Coalition" have hacked police surveillance tool in LA to protect communities of colour. The Tor Project is a browser that allows people to surf the web anonymously. This article also treats these dystopian novels as future predictions however I believe that they are more about holding up a mirror at society. Dystopian fiction teaches us that the future isn't fixed but something that is fought for. Since it is reflecting the present, it doesn't mean that we should surrender to it but rather rewrite the narrative!</p>

            <h1>ARTICLE 2</h1>
            <h2>Equal Access to Education in the Digital Age: Digital Inclusion</h2>
            
            <section>
                <p>This article examines how the shift to digital learning has increased inequalities in education, as of the COVID-19 pandemic. It argues that marginalised communities, which a low income, rural or disabled, are prevented from benefiting regardless of technology's transformative potential. This article makes it clear that the digital divide isn’t just about gadgets but about fairness too. The article doesn't sugarcoat how bad things got during the pandemic. UNESCO reported in 2020 that  over half the world’s students had no internet during lockdowns. This study was not limited to the third world countries. Even in the US, 16 million kids struggled with the “homework gap” (Pew Research, 2021). The article also gives solutions like governments teaming up with companies to hand out laptops or free data plans. But there is a catch…what if technology itself is part of the problem? The article skips over the idea of how ed-tech tools can be a bit biased. Take facial recognition software in exams. A 2023 Stanford study found these systems often misidentify Black and Asian students, leading to unfair flags for “cheating.” Yes its great and innovative to assist invigilators but how could a system misidentify specific racial groups for cheating? The article could've focused its queries on who's actually building this tech? If we want real change, why not let students from rural areas or low-income families help design these tools? Take for example groups like Black Girls Code who are taking initiative to fix this issue, teaching Black girls how to build apps that solve problems they care about like mental health or racial biases.</p>
