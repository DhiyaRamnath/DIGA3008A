            <section>
                <p>When I reflect on some of my coding practices, I've realised how easy it is to adopt a more Western framework which in turn leads to overlooking accessibility factors for marginalised users. Lots of Javascript libraries are controlled by tech giants, majority of the time always represented in media, in the west which risks sidelining alternatives for these marginalised, underrepresented communities. I think a good way to counter this is to explore smaller, open-sourced and more niche projects that prioritises localisation and low-bandwidth compatibility. This also includes tools designed for multilingual support or offline functionality. In this way we can homogenise digital spaces to amplify voices that are generally erased by dominant systems.</p>

                <p>To incorporate Javascript into my website means that I need to balance innovation and inclusivity. What I've noticed is that libraries from CDNs assumes that everyone has high speed internet access which excludes those in areas with unreliable connectivity. This means I should focus on streamlining user interactions which includes lessening page reloading, adding real-time form validation and creating collapsing menus to improve navigation. These changes are aimed to make the site faster and more intuitive especially for users with slower internet connections which is common in regions with limited technological infrastructures. For example, asynchronous content loading ensures that users on unstable networks don’t face frustrating delays, while localized error messages in forms help non-English speakers navigate without confusion. Accessibility is also another focal point. Javascript focuses on interactivity but in turn creates barriers if it isn't thoughtfully implemented. For example dynamic elements like image carousels or AJAX loaded content might break the screen readers if it isn't labelled with ARIA tags. This means that I should look at tools to help me audit the site for accessibility gaps which ensures features like keyboard navigation and semantic HTML are proiritised over the glitz and glam of cool additions to websites. This aligns with a decolonial lens where accessibility isn’t a checkbox but a commitment to dismantling exclusionary design. I think one of the most humbling lesson I've learnt is recognising the cultural assumptions embedded in code.  Date pickers defaulting to Gregorian calendars or address forms requiring “state” fields reflect a Western bias that alienates users from other regions. To counter this, I should design and implement something to allow for more flexible inputs that make the website more accessible to all users.</p>

                <p>In understanding this, decolonising coding isn't a small, one time fix but a practice that we should use in our everyday tasks in coding. This means testing the site across various devices and networks to monitor the websites performance to be mindful of those that don’t have devices and connection like we do. Another thing I have learnt is that optimising something isn't just technical but deeply rooted in politics. This means we should make knowledge systems that are indigenous. We should collaborate with those communities that are treated like data subjects and challenge the big tech extractive methods.</p>
