            <h2>What does an ethical internet look like to you?</h2>

            <section>
                <p>An ethical internet to me should function as a public sphere that's democratic. This means that diverse voices should be amplified rather than being backgrounded by algorithms that uplift what is popular. Today’s internet, unfortunately, feels more like a shouting match where the loudest, most sensational voices dominate like clickbait or ragebait. Social media platforms thrive on outrage and drama because it keeps users glued to their screens, but this comes at the cost of quieter, nuanced conversations. An ethical internet would flip this, ensuring that the marginalized groups aren’t overshadowed by louder, dominant voices. That would require us to break up the monopoly of Big Tech and support community driven alternatives, where decisions about how platforms work are made collectively. The algorithms also play a big part in making the internet unethical. They’re often biased, secretive, and unfair. An ethical internet would demand transparency. This would mean that the algorithms should be trained on various and diverse datasets that reflect the real world which includes these marginalized people and indigenous languages, not just the Western perspective. We should either look to alternative projects or create our own where we can let communities to shape policies and design features that suit them. In this way we can also avoid activists being shadowbanned and reduce the amount of ragebait and hate speech being sensationalized. Right now, the internet scarily mirrors old colonial patterns. Western tech companies mine data from African users to train AI systems but offer little in return. These systems then spit out biased results, like facial recognition tech that struggles to identify Black faces which is a clear reminder of who gets ignored in the tech world. An example that I feel is so relevant is making apps to help farmers involve themselves in the digital world to assist them to help prevent business giants from exploiting them. Orgad (2007) builds on Roger Silverstone’s notion of the internet as a “proper distance,” which advocates for accountability frameworks that hold platforms responsible for harm and dissonances it causes. (Orgad, 2007, pg. 34). To me, an ethical internet would reject this exploitation and would design tools with communities, not for them. Like for example, we could use voice assistants that speak indigenous languages. Today’s internet also feels lawless since companies and probably governments spy on users, censor content, and manipulate behaviour using algorithms. An ethical internet would treat privacy and free speech as a right, just as it is in real life law. When it comes to the digital divide, we as designers should think about our design choices like designing apps and websites that can work smoothly on slower connections, offer offline features for low connectivity areas and tools like alt-text for images so everyone, including disabled users, can participate fully.</p>
