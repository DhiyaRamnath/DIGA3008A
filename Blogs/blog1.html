            <h2>Exploring My First Website Ideas & Setting Up GitHub</h2>
            
            <section>
                <h3>Your experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages.</h3>
                <p>When I first decided to take this course, I always though building websites would be incredibly complicated, especially with the vast amount of coding knowledge out there. But once I set up GitHub and publish the site, I found it much more manageable that expected. It actually gave me peace of mind that it wasn't as intimidating as I thought it would be! However, I did struggle a bit with some of the GitHub terminology, like "push" and "fetch," but I quickly got the hang of it with a little practice.</p>

                <h3>Your goals for this course.</h3>
                <p>Although creating websites is just the basis of what I want to do, I’m really eager to dive deeper into understanding user interfaces and experiences. I’m fascinated by how human psychology intertwines with digital media, and I want to expand my expertise in this area. My goal is to design user experiences that are not only fun and interactive but also accessible for those who may not be heavy internet users. Beyond the fun side of things, I also want to improve my coding skills, especially when it comes to structuring my thinking and problem-solving using code.</p>

                <h3>Reflection on the readings you selected - relating it to your experience with the internet today & Interesting things you have found about the history of the web</h3>
                <p>I enjoyed reading Berners-Lee et al. (1994) - World Wide Web because it filled the gaps in my knowledge of the Web. The reading explained the syntaxes, protocols and the meanings and processes of the prefixes which I never understood. What I did find interesting in this reading was the prediction of the future particularly the emphasis on interactivity, which seemed to resonate throughout this week's readings. Many of these predictions are relevant today. One of the predictions that stood out to me was the idea of "integration with cocurrent editors and other real-time features such as teleconfrencing and virtual reality." (Berners-Lee, T. et al., 1994, Pg. 81). After the COVID pandemic and remote work, this feature of the Web became so prominent that businesses and workplaces were using this to keep their businesses functioning remotely. Virtual Reality has also become prominent in the modern day, especially in the gaming and animation industries with tons of different games and animations that used VR to create new experiences.</p>
                <p>Apart from learning was exactly the Web is, it was interesting to see the thinking behind the creation of the web. Although it focuses more on furthering technological development, it prioritizes the human psyche and its abilities in understanding information and associating ideas as a way to format this new sort of technology. Berners-Lee highlights how the web was designed to cater to human thinking patterns, making it easier for us to associate ideas and interact with the content. He explains "... the personalisation and adaptive hypermedia domain there is far more scope to personalise the experience of the information we gather as opposed to the use of purely static structures..." (Harper, 2010, Pg. 3). The development of Web 2.0 also shows just how important interactivity and user experience became a focal point in web development since Web 1.0 everything was "static", limited and passive using "basic CSS, HTML and frames" whereas web 2.0 was dynamic and highly interactive. (Wikipedia Contributors, 2019)</p>
                <p>Apart from how impeccable the development of the Web is, there is always some sort of down side to it, which were prominent in the articles, "A revealing look at the dot-com bubble of 2000 — and how it shapes our lives today" and "‘Crush Them’: An Oral History of the Lawsuit That Upended Silicon Valley". I think articles like this show how failures in revolutionary developments in technology and internet companies are very important lessons that people in the industry need to always keep at the back of their minds. Especially with the information overload on the internet and the speed at which its developing, its important to also just take a step and look around. These failures are crucial reminders for anyone in the industry to stay updated on news and policies, as the speed of internet development can easily leave them unaware of potentially harmful shifts in power. And since the internet is so new and its usage is increasing and is constantly in a state of development, the rules surrounding the internet have loopholes with tons of ways that actually are harmful to society and the businesses online. The Silicon Valley Lawsuit article captured this tension, quoting the defense’s argument: “One of the phrases they were using is ‘freedom to innovate.’ (Theringer.com, 2018) that was kind of the master narrative that the Microsoft legal team was advancing.” It’s a reminder that while innovation is vital, the way it’s framed can have consequences. But at the end of the day, I've come to realise that a lot of the failures that have come start ups and developments in technology are still just as important as the ones that make it big. They, if fact, end up forming the back bone of a lot of the infrastructures for online businesses. "The dot-coms from that time, the training wheels for the internet, taught us to live online." (McCullough, 2018).</p>
