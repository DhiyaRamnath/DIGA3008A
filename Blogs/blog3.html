    <h3>User Alignment & Experience Mapping in Web Design</h3>

    <p>
        <br>
            Working through the slides for Interaction Design for the web, define and discuss your user alignment, and map out your site's content, experience, and interface elements.
        <br>
        <br>
            User Alignment:
        <br>
            Simply put, the goal of this website is showcase my expertise. I aim to show users to see who I am as a designer and my focus on children's literature. I want my users to be immersed in a world of creativity that is reminiscent of a child's imagination. I also want users to have confidence in my works that I will be able to create something creative and educational that is fulfilling to a child's creativity, that I will be able to assist in building those skills. I want users to be able to view my profile and portfolio that will give them that same confidence that they want instilled in their children. I also want them to be able to view all of my works, designs and thoughts behind the design process. My target audience is parents of young children in kindergarten and primary school. My target audience is also those who are working in educational institutions that would like to utilize my skills in developing sites or designing products for children. Their purpose on my website is to be able to view who I am as a writer and web and product designer and all the works I create for their children, which I think are imperative factors that they want to be able to see if they want to make use of my services. In general, I aim for this website to a testament to my abilities to give my target audience a vouch of trust.

            Site Content:
        <br>
            My homepage should just be a summary of all the content I want to include. In the beginning, I want to include a warm introduction to who I am as a creative writer, web and product designer and highlighting my focus on children's creativity and educational development. This will form a part of my profile, leading to my portfolio. On the homepage want a section, a summary of my portfolio- this summary should be more focused on my mission statement on how I aim to influence young minds. If people wished to see more about this, they can follow the page to view my background, experience and my passion for children's literature and design. After this, there should also be a small section highlighting some of the written content, like my blogs and essays, where I share some insights to how I approach each project from a design perspective. Towards the end, there can be a small section for users to view some of my designs, consisting of the wireframe ideas I had. The most important part of my website is my introduction and my portfolio. Why I feel it is most important is because I want to build a relationship of trust with the user- that they can trust me with a service they require because they know me. The most interesting part of my site's content should be some of my works and my blogs. This I feel is going to set me apart from another designer by creating a sort of personality that a user can comprehend and relate to. It will also reinforce that relationship I aim to build with a user.

        Reflect on how the exercise above relates to what you know about your structure and URL scheme and how it relates to semantic markup.
        <br>
        Semantic Workup emphasises the structure and the different elements within a page that makes it easier for search engines to understand the content. Semantic Workup assisted me in setting up my coding structure for all of my pages. In prioritizing the structure of the information, I can keep better track of all the various content I'll put on my pages. This will help me keep up with my coding and also just make it easier for users to interpret the content more accurately and access it more efficiently. For example, if other people or developers or even the SEOs are reading my HTML, they will be able to understand the hierarchy of my content without having to keep referencing back to the nitty-gritty information or having to guess what might be most important.
