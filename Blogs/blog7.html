                <section class="website-analysis">
                    <h3>Website 1</h3>
                    <h4>Design Indaba</h4>
                    <p><a href="https://www.designindaba.com/" target="_blank">Visit Design Indaba</a></p>
                    <p>This website is not solely dedicated to fashion but is a platform that showcases South African designers and the artists from various fields like fashion.</p>
                    <p>This website uses really high quality images that captures attention. It makes it super easy to engage with this creative field in design. The visuals also highlight the South African aesthetic in art and design. I feel that the layout is also clearly defined and helps sectioning of the broad range of content. It makes navigation a lot easier without the user feeling lost. The typography is large and readable. This website includes a lot of articles and interviews so it's an important factor in this website. In terms of being responsive, this website adapts well over different devices.</p>
                    <p>This website does however feel overwhelming in terms of content. There are various fields of design content that is being presented on this website so its essence might get lost since there's a large volume of content. Also, since this images are of high quality, they might take a while to load which might cause the user to lose interest. The design is beautiful, but there's not much interactivity beyond the core content, which can make it feel a little passive compared to other more engaging sites.</p>

                    <h3>Website 2</h3>
                    <h4>Gavin Rajah</h4>
                    <p><a href="https://www.gavinrajah.com/" target="_blank">Visit Gavin Rajah</a></p>
                    <p>This website represents a high-end fashion designer who focuses on couture collections, bridal wear, and celebrity styling.</p>
                    <p>The website's aesthetic matches the high-end nature of the designer's brand to make the experience that feels premium. This matches with the color palette and imagery in the website. I feel that the design is clean and straightforward to rather emphasize the couture collections and bridal wear. There's a clear path for users to explore collections without getting distracted by unrelated content to keep focus on the items. In terms of imagery, it matches the content of the website to show the craftsmanship of the works. I think that the font choices also align with the luxury brand identity to give it a refined and professional look to the overall design of the site.</p>
                    <p>I do feel though that it could benefit from more interactive elements, such as a virtual try-on feature or better filtering options for browsing collections, considering that the items are quite expensive. The mobile experience is crowded definitely because of the visuals. The mobile version doesn't scale down the visuals smoothly which made navigation more challenging.</p>
