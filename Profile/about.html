                <p>Hi there! I'm Dhiya, an upcoming web designer with a storyteller's heart. I was born in the vibrant city of Johannesburg and raised by the sun-kissed shores of KZN. I've always been caught between two worlds; one that is structured and logical and one that is boundless and imaginative.</p>
                
                <p>Funnily enough, I once thought I'd become a lawyer, but my mind had other plans... Back in school, while equations blurred into the background, my thoughts wandered into stories, ones that I couldn't wait to bring to life in English class. That's when the question hit me: Where do these stories belong? Are they just fleeting thoughts, or do they deserve a home?</p>
                
                <p>That curiosity led me here to web design. I realized that a website isn't just a digital space but is a large canvas where stories, creativity, and ideas come to life. I hope to one day specialize in children's literature and creative storytelling, creating digital experiences that spark imagination.</p>
                
                <p class="highlight">Now if there is one important takeaway from my story, it's that your stories aren't just empty shells but treasures that are waiting to be discovered.</p>
