        <h1>About Me</h1>
        Hi there! I'm Dhiya, an upcoming web designer with a storyteller's heart. I was born in the vibrant city of Johannesburg and raised by the sun-kissed shores of KZN, I’ve always been caught between two worlds; one that is structured and logical and one that is boundless and imaginative. Funnily enough,  I once thought I’d become a lawyer, but my mind had other plans... Back in school, while equations blurred into the background, my thoughts wandered into stories, ones that I couldn't wait to bring to life in English class. That's when the question hit me: Where do these stories belong? Are they just fleeting thoughts, or do they deserve a home? That curiosity led me here to web design. I realized that a website isn’t just a digital space but is a large canvas where stories, creativity, and ideas come to life. I hope to one day specialize in children's literature and creative storytelling, creating digital experiences that spark imagination.

        Now if there is one important takeaway from my story, its that your stories aren't just empty shells but treasures that are waiting to be discovered.
