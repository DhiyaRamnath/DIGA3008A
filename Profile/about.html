            <div class="profile-content">
                <p>Hi there! I'm Dhiya, an upcoming web designer with a storyteller's heart. I was born in the vibrant city of Johannesburg and raised by the sun-kissed shores of KZN. I've always been caught between two worlds; one that is structured and logical and one that is boundless and imaginative.</p>
                
                <p>Funnily enough, I once thought I'd become a lawyer, but my mind had other plans... Back in school, while equations blurred into the background, my thoughts wandered into stories, ones that I couldn't wait to bring to life in English class. That's when the question hit me: Where do these stories belong? Are they just fleeting thoughts, or do they deserve a home?</p>
                
                <p>That curiosity led me here to web design. I realized that a website isn't just a digital space but is a large canvas where stories, creativity, and ideas come to life. I hope to one day specialize in children's literature and creative storytelling, creating digital experiences that spark imagination.</p>
                
                <p>My journey into design began with a subject in high school that bridged creativity with real-world applications. Each project spanned two terms and resulted in a comprehensive 40-page portfolio and a 3D model. I gravitated toward architecture, falling in love with designing and building dioramas. Here is the portfolio of one of my best portfolio pieces, focused in Japanese architecture and the idea of "Zen". You can view it on my <a href="../Portfolio/portfolio.html" class="read-more-link">Portfolio page.</a></p>
                
                <p>That early spark led me to pursue a degree focused on design, where I’ve explored everything from web development to animation, game design, and creative writing.</p>

                <p>Alongside my studies, I work as a digital media assistant for a South African influencer based in the UK. My role includes writing scripts, editing content, and managing her social media presence, offering insights into expat life. </p>

                <p>This experience has opened doors to collaborations with brands in both South Africa and the UK, where I assist with content strategy, post and reel design, and brand development. I also support event coordinators by designing themed boards and invites for various functions. These are some of the brands I work with.</p>

                <p class="highlight"> My ultimate goal is to specialize in children’s literature and creative storytelling, crafting digital experiences that spark curiosity and ignite imagination. Now if there is one important takeaway from my story, it's that your stories aren't just empty shells but treasures that are waiting to be discovered.</p>
