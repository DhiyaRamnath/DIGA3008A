                    <p>The 2015 "Rhodes Must Fall" movement in South Africa calls for the decolonization of institutional power and curriculum, exposing the ways in which colonial ideas and symbols continue to shape education today. Through EdTech, artificial intelligence (AI) is currently transforming education. However, this change also brings a new form of digital colonialism. AI systems continually disregard the indigenous languages and teaching methods in various countries all over the world in favour of Western thought processes and systems. It is imperative that we, as designers, investigate how AI-based tools like ChatGPT and other learning platforms replicate these patterns under the guise of innovation, just as "Rhodes Must Fall" questioned the colonial legacy in universities. By favouring Western knowledge systems, gathering data from students in the Global South, and ignoring local ways of understanding academic and educational content, this essay argues that AI EdTech perpetuates digital colonialism. These practices reflect the same oppressive structures that student activists have resisted. I demonstrate how algorithmic bias in AI education tools results in exclusion, particularly for African students, by contrasting "Rhodes Must Fall" with current EdTech criticisms.   Birhane emphasizes this idea of algorithmic colonization by stating that "Western tech monopolies, with their desire to dominate, control and influence social, political, and cultural discourse, share common characteristics with traditional colonialism." (2020, p. 389).</p>
                    
                    <p>This inequality is perpetuated by the digital divide in South Africa, where rural students  were ""caught between" the technologicised and non technologicised worlds" as of their restricted access to online education (Timmis and Muhuro, 2019, p. 6). This essay uses South Africa as a case study and connects anti-colonial education movements to current events and conversations around AI ethics. In its conclusion, it examines various forms of resistance, such as student campaigns such as #DataMustFall and initiatives to develop participatory AI models that honour African knowledge systems. The challenge of today is to face the algorithms influencing education, if Rhodes Must Fall inspired us to demolish statues. By incorporating insights from decolonial researchers such as Abeba Birhane, Christina Lutz, Mmapaseka Magenya, this essay will suggest that student development, suitable for South Africa, must involve participatory design and the encouragement of indigenous knowledge systems.</p>

                <section class="essay-section">
                    <p>In South Africa, colonial education produced systems of epistemic violence in which African languages, histories, and teaching methods were purposefully left out while Western knowledge was regarded as superior. On this point of colonial education erasure, the British created curriculums that emphasized European history, literature, and values while dismissing indigenous knowledge as outdated or irrelevant. This strategy had tangible results that are still seen today. Schools were transformed into settings where Black South African children were instructed in Afrikaans or English by colonial-trained teachers. By demanding the removal of the Cecil Rhodes statue and the decolonization of university curriculum, teaching strategies, and institutional frameworks, the Rhodes Must Fall movement contested this history. These colonial patterns run the risk of being replicated in the digital sphere by AI-based EdTech today. Modern platforms like ChatGPT and BYJU'S frequently prioritize English content and Western perspectives like previous classrooms that promoted European languages and values. The majority of large language models perform poorly in African languages like isiZulu and Sesotho because they are trained on data that is primarily composed of English and European languages. They "struggle with understanding dialects and accents…thus potentially excluding less privileged and educated users." (Lutz, 2019, p. 142). Because AI systems disregard African perspectives and promote Western concepts as "universal," this bias perpetuates the colonial exclusion of indigenous knowledge. The digital divide makes these inequalities worse. Students in rural South Africa, who already face challenges in accessing education, were left to make use of "Whatsapp" to share educational notes. (Timmis and Muhuro, 2019, p. 12). This is similar to colonial times, when children in remote areas had limited access to quality education. Even when students can use these tools, the content often reflects foreign ideas. For example, AI-generated history lessons may highlight European events while leaving out African resistance movements. This shift from colonial classrooms to AI EdTech reflects a change in method rather than a change in impact. In the past, textbooks would spread Eurocentric ideas which algorithms do now. As Rhodes Must Fall activists argued, resisting oppression means challenging both its symbols and its systems. Today, those systems are built into AI.</p>

                    <p>Artificial intelligence in education has introduced new forms of digital colonialism that continue the legacy of the past knowledge that dominated. AI-based educational tools are often presented as neutral and beneficial for all, they tend to favour Western knowledge while excluding indigenous ways of learning. This issue is most visible in three areas which are languages, data practices, and teaching methods. Firstly, there is a linguistic bias that is built into the design of many AI EdTech tools. Large language models used in platforms like ChatGPT and Duolingo perform much worse for African languages than for European ones. This perpetuates the linguistic disparities of colonial education by forcing African students to learn in colonial languages. Secondly, EdTech companies often follow extractive data practices similar to colonial economies. Global platforms such as Khan Academy and Coursera collect large amounts of data from students in the Global South but mostly offer content based on Western curricula. This assumes the continent is up from grabs for the purpose of "data extraction." (Birhane 2020, p. 392). This "data colonialism" views African students as information sources for algorithms that benefit these tech firms in the Global North. In South Africa, schools using these technologies often have little control over how the student's data is used. Thirdly, these AI tools reinforce Western ways of thinking and teaching methods through their content. For example, searches about “African history” often return content about colonial rulers, rather than pre-colonial societies or independence movements. These can "reinforce existing social inequalities and even exacerbate them because they carry over preexisting difference" (Robinson et al., 2015, p. 570).  As stated by Magenya, "the inequality of access to and representation on the internet is fast replicating existing oppression and suppression." (2020, p. 4). These African students are forced to use a system that ignore and disregard their language and histories and collect their data without consent. This expands the colonial educational system rather than merely replicating it.</p>

                    <p>As more people recognize the colonial patterns in AI, new forms of resistance and alternative approaches have begun to grow which continue the efforts of the resistance demands by the "Rhodes Must Fall" movement. In South Africa, students and educators are using the movement’s decolonial ideas to push back against digital inequalities. Protests and campaigns against the unfair data practices in education such as the #DataMustFall protest, emphasizing that real change must be made to address deeper systems. At the community level, new technologies are being created to support African ways of knowing. In fact, communities can help shape AI tools to reflect local knowledge rather than foreign ideas through "participatory action", which is encouraged by the "Decolonial AI" framework (Shakir et al. 2020, p. 17). The Masakhane NLP project directly challenges the dominance of English and other European languages in commercial EdTech by creating open-source AI tools for African languages. These projects embody what Magenya calls “making a feminist internet” which is a technology that is based on indigenous knowledge and shared control (2020, p. 6). Before some South African universities make use of EdTech, they require and demand ethical reviews to determine whether the platforms reinforce a colonial bias. Even though there are still significant obstacles such as lack of funding for the implementation of these technology audits, there are still decolonial approaches to implementing EdTech. With these audits, we can question the "technologization and digitization" of society to further the "kind of society we want to live in." (Birhane 2020, p. 408)</p>

                    <p>In this era of AI-powered education, the decolonial demands of the "Rhodes Must Fall" movement remain relevant. This essay demonstrates how commercialised and "universal" EdTech platforms reproduce colonial structures by excluding African languages, extracting learner's data in the Global South and the erasure of indigenous knowledge systems. These digital tools that appear neutral or innovative often reinforce historical patterns of inequality embedded within educational technologies. However, South Africa's resistance initiatives point toward more inclusive alternatives. Student-led campaigns, community-driven projects and institutional reforms express how  digital education do not have to follow colonial logics and instead be reshaped to fit the local context, language and teaching/learning methods. AI reflects the values of its creators and users. It reflects the values of those who build and use it. To decolonize education in the digital age, we must address both the visible technologies and its invisible systems behind them.</p>
